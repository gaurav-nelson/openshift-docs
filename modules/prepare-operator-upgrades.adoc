Before you upgrade the {rh-rhacs-first} version, you must perform the following steps:

* If you are upgrading from version 3.74, verify that you are running the latest patch release version of the {product-title-short} Operator 3.74.
* Backup your existing Central database.
* If the cluster you are upgrading contains the `SecuredCluster` custom resource (CR), change the collection method to `CORE_BPF`. For more information, see "Changing the collection method".
