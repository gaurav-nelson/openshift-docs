If the cluster that you are upgrading contains the `SecuredCluster` CR, you must ensure that the per node collection setting is set to `CORE_BPF` before you upgrade, if you are upgrading from 4.1 or later.

.Procedure

. In the {ocp} web console, go to the {product-title-short} Operator page.
. In the top navigation menu, select *Secured Cluster*.
. Click the instance name, for example, *stackrox-secured-cluster-services*.
. Use one of the following methods to change the setting:
* In the *Form view*, under *Per Node Settings* -> *Collector Settings* -> *Collection*, select *CORE_BPF*.
* Click *YAML* to open the YAML editor and locate the `spec.perNode.collector.collection` attribute. If the value is `KernelModule`, then change it to `CORE_BPF`.
. Click *Save.*
