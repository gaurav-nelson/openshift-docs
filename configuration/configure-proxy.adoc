[role="_abstract"]
If your network configuration restricts outbound traffic through proxies, you can configure proxy settings in {product-title} to route traffic through a proxy.

When you use a proxy with {product-title}:

* All outgoing HTTP, HTTPS, and other TCP traffic from Central and Scanner goes through the proxy.
* Traffic between Central and Scanner does not go through the proxy.
* The proxy configuration does not affect the other {product-title} components.
